Gibbs sampling and JAGS will be used to approximate the posterior distribution of the mixture normal model. The MCMC diagnostics, including trace plots, autocorrelation, posterior means, posterior quantiles, and effective sample sizes, will assess the convergence and efficiency of the sampling process. The software packages used for this project are R and JAGS.

The histogram and density plot in Figure 1 display the plasma glucose levels of 532 women. The data shows a right-skewed distribution. The sample mean is 121.0, the median is 115, and the mode is approximately 100. This suggests that a normal distribution may not be suitable for modeling the data.
